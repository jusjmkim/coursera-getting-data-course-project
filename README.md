# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project README

## Flow of `run_analysis.R`
1. Loads libraries `data.table` and `dplyr` for faster and easier data manipulation
2. Loads directory with data (`UCI HAR Dataset`). Should be in the same directory as `run_analysis.R` script
3. Define relevant functions for tasks
4. Pull list of features (targeting features containing "mean" and "std")
5. Compile testing data into one table
6. Compile training data into one table
7. Merge testing and training data into one table
8. Aggregate averages of all variables by subject and by activity
9. Export datasets to txt files

## Functions

### get\_sub\_file
Take type of data (e.g. "test") and converts to appropriate filename format

### convert\_to\_table
Process txt files with mappings of id numbers to description into table format

### collect\_descriptive\_activities
Collect ids for activities for all subjects and maps to activity table (generated by `convert_to_table`)

### collect\_feature\_data
Collects all feature data with column names containing the words "mean" and "std"

### compile\_raw\_data
Adds subject id, activity, and feature data into one table

### mean\_std\_cols
Looks for columns with "mean" or "std" in their names

### compile\_subject\_data
Initialize data table for each data type (i.e. testing and training) and add subject ids, activities, and feature data

### calc\_avg
Calculates average of all columns by subject id and activity
